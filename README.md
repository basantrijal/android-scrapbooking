# Scrapbooking Android App Assignment

## Internationalization language used - Nepali

This project covers all the questions below mentioned from the text book "Android HOW TO PROGRAM SECOND EDITION" page number 68.

2.5 (Scrapbooking App) Find four open source images of famous landmarks using websites such
as Flickr. Create an app in which you arrange the images in a collage. Add text that identifies each
landmark. Recall that image file names must use all lowercase letters.

2.6 (Scrapbooking App with Accessibility) Using the techniques you learned in Section 2.7, enhance
your solution to Exercise 2.5 to provide strings that can be used with Androidâ€™s TalkBack accessibility
feature. If you have an Android device available to you, test the app on the device with
TalkBack enabled.

2.7 (Scrapbooking App with Internationalization) Using the techniques you learned in
Section 2.8, enhance your solution to Exercise 2.6 to define a set of strings for another spoken language.
Use an online translator service, such as translate.google.com to translate the strings and
place them in the appropriate strings.xml resource file. Use the instructions in Section 2.8 to test
the app on an AVD (or a device if you have one available to you).
